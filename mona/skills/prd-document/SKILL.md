# PRD Document

## 0. Scope and output

Use this Skill for Product Requirements Documents, feature specifications, and product or system requirement documents intended for product, design, engineering, QA, operations, or review teams. It owns the requirement content and PRD quality checks; it does not require another writing guide.

Determine the PRD depth, structure, language, diagrams, and delivery path from the user's goal, audience, product stage, risk, and requested format. Do not fill a fixed template.

### Output format and related skills

The user's requested format and delivery channel take priority. When the user specifies a file type, use the corresponding skill:

- Word/DOCX → `mona-docx`
- Excel/XLSX → `mona-xlsx` when the PRD needs a workbook or data artifact
- PowerPoint/PPTX → `mona-pptx` when the PRD is requested as a presentation
- PDF → `pdf`
- HTML → `html-report` or the project's requested HTML workflow
- Markdown or no file type → return structured Markdown in the conversation unless the user asks for an artifact.

If no format is given, choose the smallest suitable deliverable from context and tell the user what will be produced when it materially affects the result. Never change an explicitly requested format to another format.

For Word, Excel, or PowerPoint deliverables, keep this Skill responsible for requirements content and use `mona-docx`, `mona-xlsx`, or `mona-pptx` for file creation, editing, and format-specific validation. Use diagrams and generated visuals only when they clarify requirements; follow the user's visual and brand constraints.

## 1. Core Principles

1. **Dynamic, not template-filling.** PRD depth, structure, and expression are determined by product stage, business scenario, industry constraints, organization style, and engineering concerns — never by a single fixed template.
2. **Proactive elicitation over fabrication.** When information is insufficient, ask — do not invent data, users, competitors, or timelines.
3. **Engineering executability first.** The PRD must enable engineers to proceed directly to implementation without additional clarification. Every page, field, state, and edge case must be specified. Boundaries explicit, logic closed-loop, acceptance criteria testable, risk controllable. A PRD that leaves engineers uncertain about what to build is incomplete.
4. **When words cannot clarify, use diagrams.** Any product interaction, page layout, state transition, or data flow that cannot be unambiguously conveyed through text alone requires a diagram — either drawn via Mermaid/PlantUML or generated via `generate_image` tool. Criterion: if the written description admits multiple visual interpretations, a diagram is mandatory.

---

## 2. Workflow Overview

Execute the following steps in order:

```
Step 1: Requirement Recognition → classify the request across 5 dimensions
Step 2: Information Completeness Scoring → score 9 dimensions, identify gaps
Step 3: Targeted Elicitation → ask critical questions (max 2 rounds)
Step 4: Scenario Routing → select depth, mandatory modules, emphasis
Step 5: PRD Generation → produce modular PRD with scene-adaptive structure
Step 6: Quality Self-Check → verify 14 items, annotate gaps
```

---

## 3. Requirement Recognition (Five Dimensions)

On receiving a PRD request, classify the input across these five dimensions before proceeding:

| Dimension | Classification Options |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Requirement type** | 0-to-1 product / New module / Small feature iteration / AI product / Hardware product / Fintech-compliance product / Enterprise SaaS / Government project |
| **Complexity** | Lightweight (1–3 pages) / Medium (5–15 pages) / Heavyweight (20+ pages) |
| **Audience** | Engineering / Management / Customer / Review board / QA / Algorithm team |
| **Industry** | Internet / Fintech / Hardware / SaaS / Government / Healthcare / Other |
| **Risk level** | Low (UX polish) / Medium (core flow change) / High (compliance / security / AI accuracy / customer commitment) |

**Execution rule:** Present classification as a brief table to the user. Confirm correctness before proceeding. If uncertain about any dimension, state your inference rationale and ask the user to confirm or correct.

---


## 5. Scenario Routing Matrix

Select PRD depth and mandatory modules based on scenario type:

| Scenario | Default Depth | Mandatory Modules | Emphasis | Key Risks |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|----------|-----------|
| **0-to-1 product** | Heavyweight | Market opportunity, user validation, competitive analysis, product positioning, MVP scope, architecture, roadmap, team & timeline, metrics | Why build, what first, how to validate | Scope creep, unvalidated assumptions, over-investment |
| **AI product** | Medium–Heavy | Task definition, I/O spec, accuracy metrics, evaluation methods, go/no-go criteria, fallback mechanisms, compliance | How to judge quality, error tolerance | Hallucination, unstable accuracy, insufficient evaluation, over-trust |
| **Small iteration** | Light–Medium | Current state & problem, change scope, rules, impact analysis, acceptance criteria | Fast disambiguation, strong acceptance | Missed impact, unclear acceptance, regression |
| **Fintech / compliance** | Heavyweight | Regulatory basis, permission system, risk-control rules, audit logs, exception compensation, acceptance with audit trail | Compliance + audit + security | Regulatory risk, permission breach, audit gap |
| **Hardware product** | Heavyweight | Hardware specs, firmware capabilities, device state management, production testing, after-sales plan | Spec freeze + mass-production feasibility | Spec change cost, irreversible production, compatibility |
| **Enterprise SaaS** | Medium–Heavy | Role permissions, tenant isolation, configurability, integrations, data migration, SLA | Configurable + deliverable | Permission complexity, delivery variance, insufficient configurability |
| **Government project** | Heavyweight | Policy background, construction objectives, construction scope, organizational division, implementation plan, acceptance criteria, O&M assurance | Formal + auditable + reportable | Scope disputes, acceptance ambiguity, handover risk |

**Routing rule:** Match the user's scenario to the closest row. If multiple rows apply (e.g., "AI + SaaS"), merge mandatory modules from both rows.

---

## 6. PRD Modular Template

Generate the PRD using these modules. **Select, expand, or omit modules based on the scenario routing result** — do not blindly include everything.

> **Default depth is Medium.** Unless the scenario clearly matches Lightweight or Heavyweight criteria, generate at Medium depth.

> **Plain language:** All PRD prose must use plain, everyday wording that any team member can understand on first read. Avoid consultant jargon, self-invented abstractions, and unnecessarily formal phrasing (e.g., ❌ "赋能"、"抓手"、"闭环"、"显式标注"、"触达"、"心智"). When a simpler word exists, use it.

### 6.0 Depth & Module Map

| Module | Lightweight | Medium (default) | Heavyweight |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Meta Info (version/status/history)** | Minimal (title + date only) | Minimal (title + date only) | Required |
| **Requirement Background** | Required (brief) | Required | Required (full) |
| **Objectives** | Required (may merge with Background) | Required | Required |
| **Competitive/Market/User Research** | Omit | Required (focus on competitive, with web search) | Required (full four-dimension) |
| **Functional Requirements (prototype + table)** | Required | Required | Required |
| **Timeline** | by case | Required | Required (with staffing) |
| **Data & Metrics** | by case | by case | Required |
| **Ops Planning** | by case | by case | by case |
| **Iteration Plan** | Omit | by case | Required (full roadmap) |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | by case | by case | Required |

**Typical length:** Lightweight 1–5 pages | Medium 5–10 pages | Heavyweight 10+ pages

**Section count cap:** Lightweight ≤ 5 sections | Medium ≤ 8 sections | Heavyweight no hard limit (use as needed for complex requirements).

**Meta Info rule:** For Lightweight and Medium PRDs, omit the full meta-info block (version table, status, change history). Only retain document title + creation date at the top. For Heavyweight PRDs, include the complete meta-info section (version, owner, reviewers, status, change log).

**By-case trigger rules:**

- **Data & Metrics**: Required when core business metrics change OR AB experiment validation is needed.
- **Ops Planning**: Required when cold-start, user operations, or content operations strategy is involved.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Required when high-risk flows (financial/security/compliance) or cross-team collaboration is involved.

> **Acceptance Criteria** is used internally as a go/no-go quality gate (see §9) to verify the PRD meets delivery standards before finalization.

### 6.1 Core Modules (always present)

#### Module 1: Requirement Background

- Business background and trigger source
- User current state and pain points
- Consequence of not solving
- Evidence strength annotation: `[Data-backed]` / `[Research-backed]` / `[Expert judgment]` / `[PM hypothesis]` — never present a hypothesis as fact

#### Module 2: Functional Requirements (with Prototype)

> ⚠️ **This is the PRD's core chapter.** Functional requirements must be exhaustive, visual, and engineer-actionable. Every feature module must pair a **prototype** with a **feature description**. The prototype is NOT a separate chapter — it lives inside this module.

##### 2.1 Structure: Overview Table + Module Detail (both required)

Functional requirements must include **two complementary parts**:

1. **Feature Overview Table** — A full enumeration of all feature points, providing a quick index for engineers and reviewers.
2. **Module Detail with Prototype** — Per-page/module deep description paired with inline prototype diagrams.

These are not alternatives — both are mandatory. The table gives the "what" at a glance; the module detail gives the "how" with visual proof.

---

**Part 1: Feature Overview Table**

| # | Module | Functional Description |
|---|--------|----------------------|
| 1 | Page/module name | Complete description of the feature: what it does, how users interact with it, key business rules, and constraints. Must be detailed enough to guide implementation. |

- Enumerate **every** feature point across all pages/modules.
- The "Functional Description" column must be **substantive and implementation-guiding** — not a one-line summary. Include business logic, interaction flow, and critical rules in a single cohesive paragraph.
- Feature numbers (#) are referenced in Part 2 and in prototype annotations.

---

**Part 2: Module Detail with Prototype**

Organize by page/module using headings. Each module section must include:

1. **Prototype diagram** (inline) — see §2.2 for generation strategy
2. **Functional description** per feature — written against the following dimensions (priority order):

  | Priority | Dimension | When to include | Content |
  |----------|-----------|-----------------|---------|
  | **P0** | Business logic | Always | Trigger conditions, processing rules, output results |
  | **P0** | Interaction logic | Always | User action → system response → page change |
  | **P1** | Rule constraints | When feature has complex validation | Field name/type/length/required/validation rules; state flow conditions (current state → allowed operations → next state) |
  | **P2** | Permission logic | When multi-role access differs | Role-based visibility, operation scope, data isolation |
  | **P2** | Boundary & exception | When failure modes are non-obvious | Network timeout/retry; concurrency conflict; empty data display; insufficient permission prompt |

  **Example** (an e-commerce order module):
  > - **Business logic**: User submits order → system freezes corresponding amount → status changes to "Pending Shipment" → seller ships → buyer confirms receipt → release escrowed funds.
  > - **Interaction logic**: Click "Confirm Receipt" → modal for secondary confirmation → confirm: release funds + redirect to review page; cancel: close modal, no state change.
  > - **Rule constraints**: Product title: text, 2–30 chars, required, no pure symbols; only "Pending Receipt" status allows "Confirm Receipt" and "Request Refund" operations.
  > - **Permission logic**: Admin can view all orders; buyer can only view own orders; seller can view orders related to own store.

3. **Notes** (optional): Exception scenarios, design intent, deferred items.

> **Text-prototype correspondence**: Every text description in the "Functional Description" must correspond to a specific area/component in the prototype. If a prototype has labeled zones (A, B, C...), reference them explicitly. Feature numbers from Part 1 must appear as annotations on the prototype.

##### 2.2 Prototype Generation (within Functional Requirements)

Every core page or screen must have a **prototype illustration** showing layout, information hierarchy, and element positioning. Prototypes are part of the Functional Requirements module — not a separate chapter.

> **Universal rule:** Any interaction or product concept that **cannot be unambiguously conveyed in text** must have an accompanying diagram — regardless of whether it maps to a "page". This includes complex state transitions, multi-role handoff flows, conditional UI variations, and spatial relationships between components.

**When the chosen output format is HTML**, prototypes are not limited to static wireframes:

- **Visual fidelity**: Implement near-real page layouts and visual effects, not just wireframes.
- **Simple interactions**: Include Tab switching, modal popups, state toggles, hover effects — reducing the need for multiple screenshots to explain one interaction.
- **Inline embedding**: Prototype components are embedded directly in the Feature Overview Table rows, maintaining one-to-one correspondence with feature descriptions.

**Generation strategy** (select by content type):

1. **Mermaid / PlantUML** — Best for relational/logical structures:
   - Flow charts, state machines, decision trees
   - Sequence diagrams (multi-system interaction)
   - Architecture diagrams (component relationships)
   - Navigation structures (route maps)

2. **HTML/CSS inline prototype** — Best for high-fidelity UI layout (when PRD output is HTML):
   - Near-real page layouts with cards, forms, lists, navigation
   - Typography, spacing, color, and visual hierarchy
   - Simple interactions (tab switching, modal, hover, state toggles)
   - Embeds directly in the document — prototype IS part of the deliverable

3. **`generate_image` tool (AI image generation)** — Best for visual/aesthetic content:
   - Complex spatial relationships that text cannot represent
   - Rich visual components (dashboards, data visualizations, drag-and-drop)
   - Look-and-feel that requires illustration-level detail
   - Multi-panel layouts with overlapping layers or non-linear arrangements

**Prototype content must include:**

- Page title and navigation context (where does the user arrive from?)
- All functional areas with labeled boundaries
- Field placements with annotations (name, type, constraints)
- Primary action buttons with state (enabled/disabled/loading)
- Secondary actions and their visibility conditions
- Empty states, loading states, and error states (at least as annotations)
- Responsive behavior notes (if applicable)

**Example — Mermaid wireframe for a form page:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Create Task Page"
        direction TB
        A["Header: Create New Task"]
        B["Field: Task Name (text, required, max 100 chars)"]
        C["Field: Description (textarea, optional, max 2000 chars)"]
        D["Field: Assignee (dropdown, required, source: team members)"]
        E["Field: Priority (radio: P0/P1/P2, default: P1)"]
        F["Field: Due Date (datepicker, required, min: today)"]
        G["Button: Submit (primary, disabled until all required fields valid)"]
        H["Button: Cancel (secondary, confirms if form dirty)"]
    end
    A --> B --> C --> D --> E --> F --> G
    F --> H
```

#### Module 3: Users & Scenarios

- Target user personas (with proficiency, frequency, decision authority, pain severity)
- Role separation: user / buyer / approver / admin / operator / support / developer may be different people
- Core scenarios with priority ranking
- Preconditions for usage
- For B2B / fintech / hardware / AI platform products, role decomposition is typically more important than for consumer products


### 6.3 Scenario-Triggered Modules (include when routing matches)

#### Module 4: Data & Metrics *(Medium+ depth)*

- North-star or core metric
- Process metrics: exposure, click, conversion, submission, generation, pass, share, export, reuse, retention
- Quality metrics: success rate, error rate, latency, recall, precision, satisfaction, complaint rate, manual intervention rate
- Business metrics: revenue, cost, ARPU, renewal, leads, contract conversion, operational efficiency, ticket reduction
- Tracking requirements: event name, trigger timing, property fields, user segments, funnel definitions, dashboard needs
- Baseline and target values with observation period

> Distinguish "metrics" (what to observe) from "tracking" (how to collect). PRD must not just say "need tracking" — state what decision the tracking serves.

#### Module 5: Dependencies, Risks & Timeline *(Heavyweight depth)*

- Technical dependencies: backend APIs, data warehouse, model services, device SDK, third-party platforms, permission systems, payment systems
- Team dependencies: design, algorithm, frontend, backend, QA, ops, legal, support, sales, delivery
- External dependencies: vendors, channels, regulators, partners, customer environments, hardware production, app store reviews
- Risk list with probability, impact, and mitigation strategy (degradation plan, gradual rollout, manual fallback, rollback mechanism, delayed decision point)
- Milestones: requirement review, design review, technical review, development, integration, testing, gradual rollout, full launch, retrospective

### 6.4  Competitive Research Modules (include when scenario matches)

#### Competitive Research *(Medium+ depth)*

**Standard output structure:**

```
## Competitive Research

### Research Targets
| Competitor | Product Positioning | Target Users | Scale (commercialization/market/users) | Highlights |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------|------------|

### Feature Comparison Matrix (Heavyweight only)
| Dimension | Competitor A | Competitor B | Competitor C |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Core feature 1 | ... | ... | ... |

### Research Conclusions
- Core flow comparison: operation steps / time cost / satisfaction
- Opportunities: capabilities competitors universally lack or do poorly
- Differentiation: our core advantage positioning
```

**Generation rules:**

- When using web search to gather competitor info, annotate data source and timeliness.
- Never fabricate competitor data. When information is insufficient, annotate `[To be supplemented - requires manual research]`.
- Recommend 2–4 competitors, no more than 5.
- Must include a **conclusions section** — never just list without analysis. Conclusions must contain actionable insights.

#### Market & Competitive Analysis *(0-to-1 products, extends Competitive Research)*

- Target market, user scale, growth trends, policy/tech window, entry timing
- Direct competitors, indirect competitors, adjacent platforms, manual/spreadsheet/outsourcing substitutes
- Product positioning: who we serve, who we don't, core differentiator, why we can win
- MVP scope: first-phase must-close core path; capabilities deferred; key hypothesis validation method
- Phase roadmap: MVP → Beta → GA → Scale

#### AI Accuracy & Evaluation *(AI products)*

- **Accuracy definition**: Task success criteria, quality dimensions (correctness, completeness, relevance, readability, format consistency, executability, safety, stability), subjective vs. objective metrics, per-scenario thresholds, error tolerance range
- **Evaluation system**:
  - *Offline evaluation*: Standard samples, boundary samples, negative samples, regression samples; scoring criteria (structure completeness, logic consistency, depth match, dev executability, acceptance testability, risk identification)
  - *Human review*: Reviewer roles, scoring dimensions, consistency mechanism, bad-case archival
  - *Online feedback*: Behavior metrics (edit rate, copy rate, export rate, share rate, re-ask rate, abandon rate), quality feedback (thumbs up/down, issue tags, human edit positions), efficiency metrics (time to usable output, PM revision time, engineering rejection count)
- **Go/no-go criteria**: Accuracy go, experience go, safety go, cost go, ops go
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Low-confidence prompting, human confirmation, retry, source citation, prohibition of auto-execution, rule-based fallback

#### Impact Analysis *(Small iterations)*

- Does this affect historical data? (field changes, display logic, metric definitions)
- Does this affect permissions? (different roles see different content, privilege escalation risk)
- Does this affect existing flows? (entry, navigation, notification, approval, export, search, filter)
- Does this affect analytics? (existing events still valid, new events need dashboard changes)
- Does this affect ops configuration? (back-office config, feature flags, copy config, experiment groups)

#### Compliance & Audit *(Fintech / regulated products)*

- Regulatory basis and compliance requirements
- Permission matrix (role × feature × data scope)
- Risk-control rules with trigger conditions
- Audit log requirements
- Data masking and encryption requirements
- Exception compensation and reconciliation
- User disclosure and consent requirements

#### Hardware Specifics *(Hardware products)*

- Hardware specifications, BOM constraints
- Firmware capabilities and version requirements
- Device state management and connectivity
- Environmental requirements (temperature, humidity, power consumption)
- Production testing and quality criteria
- After-sales and warranty flow

#### Multi-Tenant & Integration *(Enterprise SaaS)*

- Tenant isolation scheme
- Role-permission model (RBAC / ABAC)
- Configuration and customization capabilities
- Integration API inventory with customer systems
- Data migration and import/export
- SLA definitions and monitoring

## 9. Quality Self-Check

After generation, verify every item internally. If any item does not pass, revise the PRD content until it passes. Do NOT include the self-check table or results in the final deliverable — this checklist is for internal quality assurance only.

### 9.1 Four-Dimension Quality Scoring

Score the PRD holistically on these 4 dimensions (internal evaluation, not included in deliverable):

| Dimension | Evaluation Focus |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Requirement Description Completeness** | Does the Feature Overview Table cover all features for every page? Are prototypes clear? Are feature descriptions readable and unambiguous for engineers? |
| **Depth Match** | Does the document depth match the requirement's complexity tier (§6.0)? Neither over-engineered nor under-specified? |
| **Prototype Expressiveness** | Do prototypes accurately convey interaction intent and page layout? For HTML output, do they include simple interactions where appropriate? |
| **Expression Adaptation** | Does the writing style match the target industry, organization type, and audience? |

### 9.2 Detailed Checklist (14 Items)

| # | Check Item | Pass Criteria |
|---|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | **Background is substantive** | Answers "why build this" with trigger source — not just "we need this" |
| 4 | **User personas are specific** | No instance of "all users" or similarly vague descriptors |
| 7 | **Functional module has depth** | Every P0/P1 feature has: Feature Overview Table row + interaction diagram + prototype diagram + feature detail table. No feature is described in only 1–2 sentences |
| 8 | **Prototype diagrams present** | Every core page/screen has a prototype (Mermaid/PlantUML/ASCII wireframe or generate_image). For HTML output, prototypes include simple interactions where appropriate |
| 10 | **Analytics tracking is purposeful** | Every tracked event states what decision it serves |
| 12 | **Depth matches complexity** | Lightweight requirement ≠ 20-page document; heavyweight requirement ≠ 2-page card |
| 13 | **Internal consistency** | Objectives, features, acceptance criteria, and metrics align with each other |
| 14 | **No hallucination** | No fabricated market data, competitor facts, timelines, resources, or org structures |

---

## 10. Red-Line Rules

1. **PRD describes "what", never "how."** Do not specify database types, programming languages, or framework choices.
2. **Prototype ≠ visual design.** PRD must include wireframe-level prototypes showing information architecture, field placement, and interaction logic. But do NOT specify visual design details (color schemes, font sizes, spacing, icon styles) — those belong to the design spec.
3. **Do not fabricate data.** Business data the user has not provided (DAU, conversion rates, market size, etc.) must be marked `[To be confirmed]`.
4. **Assumptions must be explicit.** Any content the AI infers or supplements must be annotated `[Assumption — to be confirmed]`.
5. **Do not omit roles.** Any feature involving multiple roles must document every role's perspective.
